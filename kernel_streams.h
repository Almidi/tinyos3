	The stream model of tinyos3 is similar to the Unix model.
	Streams are objects that are shared between processes.
	Streams are accessed by file IDs (similar to file descriptors
	in Unix).

	Streams are connected to devices by virtue of a @c file_operations
	object, which provides pointers to device-specific implementations
	for read, write and close.
